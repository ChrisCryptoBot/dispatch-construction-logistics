## ✅ **CURRENT STATUS:**

**Load Board HAS:**
- ✅ Bid submission system (working)

- ❌ Separate date/ETA fields
- ❌ Integration with 30-min timer workflow

## 🎯 **COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION:**

Given the complexity of the Load Board update and the need to:
1. Not break existing functionality
2. Match your exact workflow
3. Integrate with carrier/customer My Loads
4. Add 30-minute timer workflow
5. Implement city-only security

**AND** given we're at 300K+ tokens already...
