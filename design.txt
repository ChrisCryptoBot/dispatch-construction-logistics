Comprehensive UI/UX Optimization Recommendations
Superior One Logistics - Carrier Dashboard🎯 CRITICAL PRIORITY (Do First)1. Construction-Specific Load Context
Current Problem: Generic "loads" don't show what carriers actually need to see
Solution:

Add Material Type badge on every load card (Crushed Stone, Ready-Mix, Rebar, etc.)
Show Equipment Type required (End Dump, Mixer, Flatbed, Lowboy, Stepdeck)
Display Rate Mode clearly ($/ton, $/yard, $/mile, $/trip, $/hour)
Add Tonnage/Volume expectations prominently
Show Equipment Match Tier (Green=Optimal, Yellow=Acceptable, Orange=Unusual with your equipment)
2. Quick Filters - Missing Critical Categories
Current: Basic filters exist but incomplete
Add:

"Scale Ticket Required" - Shows loads needing weighing
"Prevailing Wage" - Public projects with certified payroll requirements
"Overweight Permit Required" - Flags loads needing special permits
"Multi-Trip Shuttle" - Recurring quarry→site runs
"QuickPay Eligible" - 36-hour payment available
"Hot Loads" - Same-day needs
"My Zones" - Loads in carrier's preferred metro areas
"My Lanes" - OTR routes carrier has run before
Filter by Distance: <50mi / 50-150mi / 150+mi
Filter by Equipment I Own: Auto-match to carrier's fleet
3. Revenue Transparency - Show True Earnings
Current: Shows $42,180 monthly revenue but missing breakdown
Add:

Gross Revenue vs Net After Deductions
Per-Mile True Rate: (Revenue - Tolls - Dump Fees) ÷ (Miles + Deadhead)
Accessorials Captured: Detention, TONU, fuel surcharge, dump fees
Payment Status Breakdown:

Pending (awaiting POD)
In QuickPay (36h countdown)
In BYOF (factor processing)
Paid (completed)


DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) - Average time to cash
QuickPay Discount Paid: Total fees paid for fast funding
4. Real-Time Payment Tracking
Missing: No visibility into payment pipeline
Add:

"Payments" widget on dashboard showing:

"Next Payment Due: $2,850 in 18 hours" (countdown timer)
"Awaiting POD Upload: 3 loads, $8,450"
"In QuickPay Processing: 2 loads, $5,200"
"This Week's Earnings: $12,340 (paid) + $6,780 (pending)"


Escrow Status Indicators: Funded/Released/Disputed
Factor Integration Status: NOA active, payments routing to [Factor Name]
5. Scale Ticket Workflow Integration
Current: "Scale Tickets" in sidebar but no workflow visible
Critical for Construction:

OCR Photo Upload: Giant camera button "Snap Scale Ticket"
Auto-Parse Display: Show Tare/Gross/Net weights extracted
Tonnage vs Expected Alert: "Delivered 23.5 tons (expected 25 tons) - confirm?"
Revenue Auto-Calc: "23.5 tons × $45/ton = $1,057.50 + $75 dump fee + $23 FSC = $1,155.50 gross"
Mismatch Warnings: "BOL shows 25 tons, scale ticket shows 23.5 tons - resolve before payout"
History: All scale tickets for a job site/customer in one view
